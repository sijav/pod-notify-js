# Contributing Guidelines
You can send me your thoughts about making this repo great :) [Email](sinajavaheri@gmail.com)

### Testing & Travis ###
Pod Notify JS uses the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io/1.0/index.html) JavaScript test runner, so read up on that if you want to make changes to any of the tests that are run. The tests might want to be expanded though.

### REAL IMPORTANT STUFF ###
**THERE IS ONLY ONE RULE**. **WHENEVER** you make changes to `pod-notify-js.js`, **RECOMPILE** and commit `pod-notify-js.min.js` as well.
**YOUR PR WILL NOT BE APPROVED UNLESS THIS HAPPENS**.

Outside of that, contributing should be a positive process.
